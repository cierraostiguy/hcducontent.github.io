# Capitalization
{: .no_toc }

Use sentence case (only capitalize the first word and proper nouns and acronyms) in all titles, headings, menu items, labels, and buttons.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## DO Capitalize
- The first letter of the first word of any label or sentence (this sentence is an example!)
- Proper nouns (Maryland, Medicaid, John Smith)
- Titles of official publications, laws, or products (Alternative Benefit Plan, the Social Security Act, Gmail)

## DON'T Capitalize
- Words other than the first word, other than proper nouns
- Common nouns
- Specific processes or products (waivers, email)
- Other things to think about
- Acronyms should almost always be in all capital letters. See word list for exceptions. When in doubt about whether to capitalize, consult AP style.
